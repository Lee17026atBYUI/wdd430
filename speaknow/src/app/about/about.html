<p>Use this web app to find suggestions for people to give talks in Sacrament Meeting. This is just based on the longest time since they last spoke.</p>
<p>When adding a new member, only the name (minimum 3 characters) is required.</p>
<p>If they accepted the invitation, you can quickly mark that they gave a talk (pretend it's today).</p>
<p>If someone is not currently interested, you can bump them down the list. They will show up again later (3 months).</p>
